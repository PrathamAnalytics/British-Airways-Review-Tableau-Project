This project analyzes customer reviews for British Airways (BA) to assess passenger satisfaction across various factors, including service quality, comfort, food, and entertainment. The project combines review text analysis with numerical rating insights to provide a data-driven overview of BA's customer experience.

- **Data Sources:** BA review data, country data for geographic insights.

- **Objectives:** Understand drivers of customer satisfaction and provide actionable insights for service improvement.

# Data Description 

This project leverages data from customer reviews of British Airways flights, combined with country information to analyze global perspectives on service quality. The dataset includes detailed reviews left by passengers on various aspects of their flight experience, such as comfort, food quality, and customer service. This data allows for a comprehensive exploration of factors that impact customer satisfaction, including flight route, traveler type, and regional feedback patterns.

### Data Sources
1. **Customer Review Data ([ba_reviews.csv](./ba_reviews.csv))**  
   This file contains the primary data on individual reviews, with information on:
   - **Review Details**: Text-based feedback summarizing the reviewerâ€™s experience.
   - **Ratings**: Quantitative scores (1-5 scale) across categories such as seating comfort, in-flight entertainment, food and beverages, and ground service.
   - **Traveler Information**: Insights into traveler demographics and flight details, including traveler type (business, leisure) and seat class (economy, business).
   - **Flight Route & Aircraft Model**: Specific flight paths and the type of aircraft used, which help contextualize service quality in various scenarios.

2. **Country Data (`Countries.csv`)**  
   The country dataset enriches the analysis by linking reviews to geographical regions. This data enables segmentation of reviews based on the origin of the reviewer, facilitating an understanding of satisfaction trends by country or region. Key fields include:
   - **Country Name and Code**: Standardized country information to correlate with review origins.
   - **Continent and Region**: Classification to analyze regional trends, allowing for a breakdown of satisfaction across continents or specific regions.

### Purpose of the Data
The combination of review and country data supports a multi-dimensional analysis of British Airways' customer feedback. By correlating reviews with geographical information, we aim to reveal:
   - **Regional Service Preferences**: How satisfaction varies by traveler origin, potentially indicating regional expectations for service.
   - **Performance by Flight and Traveler Type**: Insights into how specific routes, aircraft types, and traveler categories (business vs. leisure) impact overall ratings.
   - **Category-Specific Strengths and Weaknesses**: Analysis of key service areas like cabin staff, entertainment, and food quality to identify operational improvement areas.

This dataset provides a strong foundation for both quantitative and qualitative insights into the British Airways customer experience, forming the basis for strategic recommendations on service improvements.
